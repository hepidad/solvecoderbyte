Letter Count I

http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/GuestEditor.php?ct=Letter%20Count%20I&lan=Python 

Using the Python language, have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the 
first word with the greatest number of repeated letters.
For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and 
it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. 
Words will be separated by spaces.

  more = " indented in Python!"
  return text + more
